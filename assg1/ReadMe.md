In NALI 2023, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) showcased its commitment to innovative learning through the Center for Advancement in Digital and Flexible Learning (UTM CDex). The New Academia Learning Innovation event introduced in 2018 has become an annual knowledge-sharing platform, culminating in the 2023 edition themed "Resilience Education for Future-Oriented Quality Graduate." At the event, the focus was on diverse learning models fostering entrepreneurial academia. A highlight was the presentation on UTM Sustainability's E-Bike Tracking System, addressing environmental concerns with smart technology. The poster detailed the use of IoT, GPS, and GSM technologies, illustrating a real-time tracking system for E-Bikes on campus. The project not only addressed environmental issues but also considered future enhancements, emphasizing sustainability, innovation, and well-being.

Engaging in NALI 2023 provided a unique and comprehensive learning experience that extended beyond the traditional course boundaries. The applied methods, particularly problem-solving-based learning, showcased the impact of innovative approaches. Personally, the event offered a broader perspective on various technologies, sparking a notable desire to explore further using the techniques and skills presented. The activities undertaken, from practicing skills applicable in diverse fields to conducting interviews and reporting scientific material, contributed to a more holistic understanding. NALI 2023 left an indelible mark on my learning journey, offering an unforgettable experience that went beyond the routine course structure.
