The PC Assembly lab at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) is a cool place where students learn to put together computers. It's like a hands-on workshop where we get to explore and understand how computers are built, especially focusing on the hardware parts.

In the PC Assembly lab, we have all the latest computer parts and tools we need to build our own computers. The lab is like a playground for learning – we follow step-by-step instructions to assemble things like motherboards, processors, memory, and graphics cards. The best part is, we get to see how all these parts come together to make a working computer!

Our instructors are like guides, helping us through the process and teaching us how to solve problems if something goes wrong. They make sure we not only read about computer hardware but also actually build and understand how it all works. We can ask questions and work together with our classmates on projects, making it a fun and interactive learning experience.

Reflection:
Being in the PC Assembly lab has been super cool! I've learned so much about how computers are put together and how to fix things if they don't work. The instructors are really helpful, and I've made friends while working on projects together. It's not just about computers – it's also about learning to work with others and figuring things out on our own. I feel more confident about computers now, and I know these skills will be useful for whatever I do in the future.
